Distributed: Each developer hasa copy of the wjole repository on their local machine

# To clone a repository:
git clone <repository link>


# To push the commit to remote repository
git push


# To fetch the latest commits from the remote repository and merge
git pull


# To save our username and password for the remote repository:
gir config --global credential.helper cache


# To get more information about remote:
git remote show origin


# To look at the remote branches
git branch -r

If we want to make changes to the remote branch, we Pull the remote branch, merge it with the local branch,
then push it back to its origin


# To sync local repository with remote repository:
git fetch

The difference between git fetch and git pull is:
git fetch fetches remote updates but doesn't merge; git pull fetches remote updates and merges.

# If we want to merge the changes from the remote repository into the local repository
git merge origin/master




# To create a local branch to associate it with a already created remote branch
git checkout <branch name>  # git will automatically copy the contents of the remote branch to the local branch.


# In order to get the contents of a remote branch without automatically merging
git remote update


# Typical git workflow - pull -> merge -> push


# After resolving merge conflict with the remote repository:
git add <conflicting file name>
git commit


# To push a commit into a remote branch
git push -u origin <branch name>


# To commit into a remote branch with a fast forward merge
git checkout <branch name>
git rebase master  # It will move the current branch on top of the master branch


# To merge the new branch with the master branch
git checkout master
git merge refactor


# Te√≥ remove a branch
git push --delete origin <branch name>  # It will delete the remote branch
git branch -d <branch name>  # It will delete the local branch
